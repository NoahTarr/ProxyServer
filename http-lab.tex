\subsection{The Basic HTTP GET/Response Interaction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is your browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1?  What version of HTTP is
  the server running?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Both my browser and the server are running HTTP version 1.1.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-browser-http-version}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-server-http-version}
  \end{itemize}
\item What languages (if any) does your browser indicate that it can accept to
  the server?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item My browser indicates that it accepts US English.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-browser-language}
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the IP address of your computer?  Of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item My IP address is 192.168.1.127, while the server's IP address is
    128.119.245.12.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-my-ip}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-server-ip}
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The server returned $200$ for the HTML file and $404$ for favico.ico.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-status-code-1}
  \item \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-status-code-2}
  \end{itemize}
\item When was the HTML file that you are retrieving last modified at the
  server?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It was last modified on March 3, 2021, at 06:59:01 GMT.\
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-last-modified}
  \end{itemize}
\item How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There were $128$ bytes for the HTML file, and $209$ bytes for
    favico.ico.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-content-size-1}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-content-size-2}
  \end{itemize}
\item By inspecting the raw data in the packet content window, do you see any
  headers within the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window?  If
  so, name one.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I do not see any headers that are not displayed.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-raw-data-1}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-raw-data-2}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-raw-data-3}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-raw-data-4}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The HTTP CONDITIONAL GET/response interaction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to
  the server.  Do you see an ``IF-MODIFIED-SINCE'' line in the HTTP GET?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I do not see an ``IF-MODIFIED-SINCE'' line in the HTTP GET.\
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-if-modified-since-1}
  \end{itemize}
\item Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly
  return the contents of the file?  How can you tell?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The server explicitly returned the contents.  I can tell because the
    response contains the HTML file content, and content fields like
    ``Content-Type'' and ``Content Length'' are set.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-html-contents}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-html-content-type}
  \end{itemize}
\item Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser
  to the server.  Do you see an ``IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:'' line in the HTTP GET?  If
  so, what information follows the ``IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:'' header?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There is an ``If-Modified-Since'' line, and it contains ``Wed, 03 Mar
    2021 06:59:01 GMT''.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-if-modified-since-2}
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in
  response to this second HTTP GET?  Did the server explicitly return the
  contents of the file?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The HTTP status code is $304$ and the response phrase is ``Not
    Modified''.  The server did not explicitly return the contents of the file,
    as none of the signs described in the response to question 9 appeared
    here.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-conditional-status-phrase}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Retrieving Long Documents}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{11}
\item How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send?  Which packet
  number in the trace contains the GET message for the Bill or Rights?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item My browser sent one HTTP GET request.  The packet number was $63$.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-long-get}
  \end{itemize}
\item Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase
  associated with the response to the HTTP GET request?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The packet number is $65$.  We see that the response was broken into $2$
    TCP segments.  The raw data of the first segment, packet $65$, is
    highlighted in blue, and we see the HTTP status code and phrase at the top
    of the raw data.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-packet-number-long-doc}
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the status code and phrase in the response?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The status code is $200$, and the phrase is ``OK''.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-long-doc-status-code-phrase}
  \end{itemize}
\item How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP
  response and the text of the Bill of Rights?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $2$ data-containing TCP segments were needed.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-long-doc-tcp-count}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{HTML Documents with Embedded Objects}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{15}
\item How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send?  To which
  Internet addresses were these GET requests sent?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $3$ HTTP GET requests were sent.  The first two went to
    128.119.245.12 (\texttt{gaia.cs.umass.edu}), while the third went to
    178.79.137.164 (\texttt{kurose.cslash.net}).
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-get-count}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-ip-1}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-host-1}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-ip-2}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-host-2}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-ip-3}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-host-3}
  \end{itemize}
\item Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or
  whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel?  Explain.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The images were downloaded serially.  The last packet for
    \texttt{pearson.png} (packet $99$) arrived before the GET request for
    \texttt{8E\_cover\_small.jpg} (packet $104$) was sent.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-embed-order}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{HTTP Authentication}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{17}
\item What is the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the
  initial HTTP GET message from your browser?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The server responded with $401$ and ``Unauthorized''.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-auth-1}
  \end{itemize}
\item When your browser’s sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what
  new field is included in the HTTP GET message?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The ``Authorization'' and ``Cache-Control'' fields are new.
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-auth-new-fields-1}
  \item \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ws-auth-new-fields-2}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{DNS and \texttt{dig}}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Starting with a root DNS server (from one of the root servers
  [a-m].root-servers.net), initiate a sequence of queries for the IP address for
  your department’s Web server by using dig. Show the list of the names of DNS
  servers in the delegation chain in answering your query.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I followed the DNS servers \texttt{a.root-servers.net} $\rightarrow$
    \texttt{a.edu-servers.net} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{dns-two.ucdavis.edu}.  The IP
    addresses are listed in the last screenshot under ``ANSWER SECTION''.
